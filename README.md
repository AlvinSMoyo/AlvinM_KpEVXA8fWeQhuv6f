## 📝 Project Overview

The **Happy Customers Project**, developed during my time at **Apziva**, focuses on analyzing customer feedback to assess satisfaction levels and uncover opportunities for improving user experience.  
Using **data preprocessing**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, and **data visualization**, the project aims to extract actionable insights from raw feedback data and drive data-informed decisions.

---

## 🔄 Project Workflow

The project was executed in clearly defined stages:

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Gathered and explored customer feedback datasets from multiple sources.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned data by handling null values, standardizing text, and formatting entries for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Identified trends and anomalies using visual and statistical techniques.

4. **Sentiment Analysis**  
   - Applied NLP tools (like TextBlob/VADER/spaCy) to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.

5. **Data Visualization**  
   - Built clear and compelling visualizations to highlight key trends and insights using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

6. **Reporting and Recommendations**  
   - Summarized insights and offered strategic recommendations to improve customer satisfaction and retention.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** – Core programming language for analysis and modeling  
- **Pandas** – For data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – For numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – For creating detailed visualizations  
- **NLTK / spaCy / TextBlob** – For natural language processing and sentiment analysis  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For interactive analysis and presentation  
- **Git & GitHub** – For version control and collaboration

## 🎁 Bonus Module: NLP-Based Insight Extraction

To extend the analysis, a simulated `Comments` column was generated using Likert-scale responses to mimic open-ended feedback.  
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques were applied to extract sentiment and highlight dominant feedback themes.

**Techniques Used:**
- **TextBlob** – for polarity scoring  
- **TF-IDF** – to extract weighted keywords  
- **WordCloud** – to visualize common terms by sentiment group

This module demonstrates how structured feedback can be enriched through synthetic NLP analysis, adding storytelling and insight for decision-makers.

## 🙌 Final Thoughts

This project was a valuable opportunity to:
- Work independently through a full end-to-end data science workflow  
- Apply machine learning and data analysis to solve a real-world business problem  
- Communicate insights clearly through visualizations and interpretation tools like SHAP  

From data wrangling to sentiment modeling and storytelling with data, this project reflects a practical approach to using data for meaningful insights.

**Thanks for exploring my work!** I hope it provides value or inspiration for your own data science journey. 🚀
